# Cognitive load

Cognitive load, in the context of product design and usability, refers to the amount of mental effort or processing capacity that users must expend to interact with a product, understand its interface, and accomplish tasks. Cognitive load is a crucial concept in user experience (UX) design, as minimizing unnecessary cognitive load can significantly improve a product's usability and user satisfaction.

There are three main types of cognitive load that designers consider in product designâ€¦

Intrinsic Cognitive Load: This is the cognitive load associated with the inherent complexity of a task or the information being processed. Some tasks are naturally more complex and will have a higher intrinsic cognitive load. Designers cannot eliminate intrinsic cognitive load, but they can work to make it as manageable as possible by simplifying tasks and providing clear instructions.

Extraneous Cognitive Load: This is the unnecessary cognitive load imposed by the design and presentation of the product. It results from poor user interface design, confusing navigation, unclear instructions, and other elements that create confusion or frustration for users. Reducing extraneous cognitive load is a key goal in product design.

Germane Cognitive Load: This is the cognitive load that is beneficial and necessary for learning and problem-solving. It represents the mental effort required for users to understand and integrate new information or adapt to a new system. Designers aim to make germane cognitive load as efficient as possible by presenting information and tasks in a clear and organized manner.
