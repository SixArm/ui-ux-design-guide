## Professional

For work, I consult for companies that seek to leverage technology capabilities and business capabilities, such as hands-on coding and growth leadership. Clients range from venture capital startups to Fortune 500 enterprises to nonprofit organizations.

For technology capabilities, I provide repositories for developers who work with architecture decision records, functional specifications, system quality attributes, git workflow recommendations, monorepo versus polyrepo guidance, and hands-on code demonstrations.

For business capabilities, I provide repositories for managers who work with objectives and key results (OKRs), key performance indicators (KPIs), strategic balanced scorecards (SBS), value stream mappings (VSMs), statements of work (SOWs), and similar practices.


## Personal

I advocate for charitable donations to help improve our world. Some of my favorite charities are Apache Software Foundation (ASF), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Free Software Foundation (FSF), Amnesty International (AI), Center for Environmental Health (CEH), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and Human Rights Watch (HRW).

I write free libre open source software (FLOSS). I'm an avid traveler and enjoy getting to know new people, new places, and new cultures. I love music and play guitar.
