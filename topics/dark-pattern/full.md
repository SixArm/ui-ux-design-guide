# Dark pattern

Dark patterns in UI/UX design refer to deceptive or manipulative techniques used to influence user behavior in ways that may not align with their best interests. These design patterns often exploit cognitive biases and psychological principles to trick or mislead users into taking certain actions or making decisions they may not have intended to make.

Here are a few common types of dark patterns:

* Misdirection: The design intentionally draws attention away from certain options or information, leading users to make unintended choices.

* Forced Continuity: Users are enrolled in a free trial or subscription without their explicit knowledge or consent, and it becomes challenging to cancel or unsubscribe.

* Hidden Costs: Additional fees, charges, or subscriptions are hidden or obscured until the user reaches the checkout or payment stage.

* Roach Motel: It is easy to get into a certain situation or sign up for a service, but it becomes challenging or impossible to cancel or leave.

* Sneak into Basket: Items or services are added to the user's shopping cart without their consent, often during the checkout process.

* Friend Spam: The design encourages users to share or invite their friends but takes advantage of their personal network without their explicit consent.

* Urgency: False or exaggerated time pressure is created to push users into making quick decisions without adequate consideration.

It's important to note that dark patterns are generally considered unethical and can harm the user experience, erode trust, and damage the reputation of a product or brand. Ethical UI/UX design practices prioritize transparency, honesty, and respect for the user's autonomy and well-being. Designers should strive to create intuitive, transparent, and user-centric experiences that provide genuine value and meet users' needs.
