Urgency: False or exaggerated time pressure is created to push users into making quick decisions without adequate consideration.

Forced Continuity: Users are enrolled in a free trial or subscription without their explicit knowledge or consent, and it's hard to exit.

Roach Motel: It is easy to get into a certain situation, but it becomes challenging or impossible to leave.

Hidden Costs: Additional fees, charges, or subscriptions are hidden or obscured, such as with fine print, or asterisk disclaimers.

Sneak into Basket: Items or services are added to the user's shopping cart without their consent, often during the checkout process.

Friend Spam: The design encourages users to share or invite their friends but takes advantage of their personal network without their explicit consent.
