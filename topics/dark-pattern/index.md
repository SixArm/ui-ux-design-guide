# Dark pattern

A dark pattern in UI/UX design refer to deceptive techniques used to influence user behavior. These  patterns exploit cognitive biases and psychological principles to trick or mislead users. Dark patterns are unethical and harm the user experience.

**Examples:**

* **Misdirection:** The design intentionally draws attention away from certain options or information, leading users to make unintended choices.

* **Urgency:** False or exaggerated time pressure is created to push users into making quick decisions without adequate consideration.

* **Forced Continuity:** Users are enrolled in a free trial or subscription without their explicit knowledge or consent, and it's hard to exit.

* **Roach Motel:** It is easy to get into a certain situation, but it becomes challenging or impossible to leave.

* **Hidden Costs:** Additional fees, charges, or subscriptions are hidden or obscured, such as with fine print, or asterisk disclaimers.

* **Sneak into Basket:** Items or services are added to the user's shopping cart without their consent, often during the checkout process.

* **Friend Spam:** The design encourages users to share or invite their friends but takes advantage of their personal network without their explicit consent.
