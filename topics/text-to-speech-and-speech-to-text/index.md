# Text-To-Speech (TTS) and Speech-To-Text (STT)

Text-To-Speech (TTS) and Speech-To-Text (STT) are two technologies that enable the conversion of text and speech, respectively, into their corresponding formats. These technologies have various applications across different fields, including accessibility, communication, and automation.

Text-To-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. It takes textual input and uses speech synthesis algorithms to generate audible speech output. TTS systems analyze the text and apply linguistic rules and voice synthesis techniques to produce natural-sounding speech. The synthesized speech can be played through speakers, headphones, or other audio output devices. TTS is commonly used in applications such as assistive technology for individuals with visual impairments, language learning tools, e-books, and voice assistants.

Speech-To-Text (STT) is a technology that converts spoken words into written text. It involves analyzing audio input, typically from a microphone or a recorded source, and using speech recognition algorithms to transcribe the spoken words into text form. STT systems utilize various techniques, including acoustic modeling, language modeling, and machine learning algorithms, to interpret and convert speech accurately. STT finds applications in transcription services, voice-controlled systems, voice assistants, real-time captioning, and more. STT is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR).

TTS and STT are often used together in applications that require seamless voice interaction. For example, voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa utilize both TTS and STT technologies to understand spoken commands and respond with synthesized speech.
