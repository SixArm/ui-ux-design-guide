# The Law of Conservation of Complexity

The Law of Conservation of Complexity, also known as Tesler's Law, is a design principle that was formulated by Larry Tesler, a computer scientist who worked for Xerox PARC and Apple. The Law states that complexity is a finite resource that must be conserved, and that every increase in complexity in one part of a system must be offset by a corresponding decrease in complexity elsewhere.

In other words, the Law is a call for simplicity in design. It suggests that designers and developers should strive to make their products as simple and easy to use as possible, by minimizing unnecessary complexity and focusing on the most important features and functions. This is particularly important in today's technology landscape, where users are inundated with a vast array of products and services, many of which are needlessly complex and difficult to use.

The Law is particularly relevant in the field of user experience (UX) design, where the goal is to create interfaces and interactions that are intuitive, efficient, and satisfying for users. By following this principle, designers can create products that are not only easier to use, but also more accessible to a wider range of users, including those with disabilities or other special needs.

In practice, the Law can be applied in a variety of ways. For example, designers can use it to simplify interfaces by removing unnecessary buttons, menus, or other elements that can confuse or overwhelm users. They can also use it to streamline workflows and reduce the number of steps required to complete a task, making it easier for users to achieve their goals.
