# AI form fill

AI form fill, also known as form autofill or autocomplete, refers to the functionality provided by artificial intelligence systems to automatically populate form fields with relevant information, reducing the effort required for users to enter data manually.

When enabled, AI form fill utilizes various techniques to recognize and extract relevant information from a user's previous interactions, stored data, or external sources. This information may include personal details like name, address, email, phone number, and other commonly requested data points.

Typical stepsâ€¦

Data Collection: The AI system collects and stores relevant data from various sources, such as user inputs, previous form submissions, user profiles, or external data providers.

Data Analysis and Prediction: The system analyzes the collected data, identifies patterns and relationships, and predicts the most likely values for each form field based on the context and user history.

Autofill Suggestions: Based on the predictions, the AI system generates autofill suggestions or recommendations for each form field. These suggestions are usually displayed as dropdown menus or overlays near the respective form fields.

User Confirmation: The user reviews the autofill suggestions and selects the appropriate values for each field. They can accept the suggestions as-is or make changes if necessary.

Form Field Population: Once the user confirms the autofill selections, the AI system populates the corresponding form fields with the chosen values automatically.
