# Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a creative problem-solving technique used to generate a large number of ideas in a short period of time. The goal is to promote a free-flowing and non-linear environment that allows for the exploration of diverse perspectives and possibilities, related to a specific topic or problem.

Brainstorming is widely used in various settings, including business, education, and problem-solving contexts, to foster innovation, creativity, and generate a wide range of ideas that can lead to new insights and solutions.

During brainstorming, participants are encouraged to suspend judgment and criticism and focus on generating as many ideas as possible. After brainstorming, evaluate the ideas.

Key principlesâ€¦

Quantity over Quality: Generate many ideas without immediately evaluating or analyzing their feasibility.

Non-judgmental Atmosphere: Refrain from criticizing or evaluating ideas during the brainstorming phase.

Free Thinking: Encourage ideas that are unconventional, imaginative, and even seemingly wild.

Build on Ideas: Build on or combine the ideas of others. This promotes collaboration and interaction.

Participation: Give everyone an opportunity to contribute, such as via round-robin or equal airtime.

Timebox: Set a time limit for the brainstorming phase, to helps maintain focus and energy.

Capture: Document ideas in a visible accessible format, such as a whiteboard, flipchart, or web app.
