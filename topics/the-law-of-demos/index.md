# The Law of Demos

The Law of Demos, also known as Kapor's Law, is a principle that states that any technology demo will eventually fail if it is demonstrated often enough. This law was first formulated by Mitch Kapor, co-founder of Lotus Development Corporation, in 1983.

The idea behind the Law of Demos is that demos are essentially fake, controlled environments that do not accurately represent the real world. Demos are designed to showcase the best features of a product or technology, and they often ignore or gloss over any flaws or limitations that may exist. As a result, demos can create unrealistic expectations in the minds of the audience.

According to the Law of Demos, the more times a technology demo is shown, the more likely it is that the flaws and limitations of the technology will become apparent. The audience may become skeptical or disillusioned, and the technology may lose its appeal. This can be particularly problematic for startups or new technologies that rely on hype and buzz to attract investors and users.

One solution to the problem of the Law of Demos is to be transparent about the limitations and challenges of a technology, even during a demo. By acknowledging the flaws and limitations upfront, a company can build trust with its audience and demonstrate that it is committed to addressing any issues that may arise.

The Law of Demos is a reminder that technology demos are not a substitute for real-world testing and that startups and companies should be honest and transparent about the capabilities and limitations of their products and technologies.
