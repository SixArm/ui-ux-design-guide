# ARIA attributes

The ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are a set of HTML attributes that can be used to enhance the accessibility of web content for individuals with disabilities. ARIA attributes are particularly useful for making dynamic web applications and interactive components more accessible to assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

**Key aspects**:

Purpose: ARIA attributes provide additional information to assistive technologies that cannot be conveyed through standard HTML tags. They help describe the functionality, state, and behavior of elements in a way that can be interpreted by screen readers and other assistive devices.

ARIA Roles: The role attribute is used to define the role or type of an element. It allows you to specify the purpose or function of an element beyond its default role. For example, to indicate that a div element functions as a button or a menu.

ARIA States and Properties: ARIA attributes also can describe the state and properties of elements. For example, the aria-expanded attribute can be used to indicate whether a collapsible section is expanded or collapsed.

Enhancing Interactive Elements: ARIA attributes are helpful for making interactive elements, such as menus, tabs, and sliders, accessible. They allow assistive technologies to understand and communicate the functionality and behavior of these elements.

Integration with JavaScript: ARIA attributes are often used in conjunction with JavaScript. JavaScript can be used to update the ARIA attributes dynamically as the user interacts with the page, ensuring that the accessibility information remains up to date.

Compatibility and Support: ARIA attributes are supported by most modern web browsers and widely recognized by assistive technologies.
