# Graceful degradation

Graceful degradation, in the context of UI/UX design, refers to a design approach that ensures a website or application functions and remains usable even when certain features or technologies are not supported or available in the user's environment. Graceful degradation is the complement of progressive enhancement.

**Key aspects:**

* **User Experience:** Aim to provide a positive user experience for all users, regardless of their device, browser, or technological limitations. Ensures that even if a user's system does not support certain features, they can still access and interact with the core functionality of the website or application.

* **Design Prioritization:** Identify and prioritize essential features and content that are fundamental to the user experience. These core elements should be designed to work across different platforms and be accessible to all users.

* **Feature Detection:** Use feature detection techniques to identify the capabilities of the user's device or browser. By detecting what features are available, the design can adapt and provide an appropriate user experience that suits the user's environment.

* **Responsive Design:** Enable the layout and content to adapt and adjust based on the user's screen size and device capabilities. This ensures that the user experience remains optimal, regardless of the device being used.

* **Robust Error Handling:** Handle situations if a capability is unavailable, such as by providing suitable error messages and notifications that informative and clear. Provide alternative paths or options for users to continue their journey.
