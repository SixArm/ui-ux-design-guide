# Mermaid.js

Mermaid.js is a JavaScript-based library that allows you to create diagrams and flowcharts directly in the browser. It provides a simple way to define diagrams using a Markdown-inspired syntax, and to embed diagrams in webpages, documents, or presentations.

**Key aspects:**

* **Diagram Types:** Includes flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, class diagrams, state diagrams, pie charts, and more.

* **Markdown Syntax:** Uses a concise and human-readable Markdown-like syntax for defining diagrams. This makes it easy to write and understand the diagram specifications, even for non-technical users.

* **Browser-Based:** Runs entirely in the browser. There is no need for server-side processing or dependencies on external servers. This makes it convenient for creating and sharing diagrams on websites.

* **Interactive and Live Rendering:** Mermaid.js automatically renders the diagrams in real-time as you write or modify the diagram specifications. You can see the immediate visual representation.

* **Customization:** Mermaid.js provides various options for customizing the appearance and style of the diagrams. You can change colors, fonts, arrow styles, line thickness, and other attributes.

* **Integration:** Mermaid.js can be easily integrated into Markdown editors, content management systems (CMS), documentation tools, or any web-based application. It supports exporting diagrams as SVG or PNG images.
