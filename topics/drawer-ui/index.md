# Drawer UI

A drawer user interface, also known as a slide-out menu or navigation panel, is a graphical control that provides a hidden panel that can be revealed by sliding it into view from the edge of the screen. It is commonly used in mobile and web applications to display additional navigation options or content without taking up much screen space.

**Key aspects:**

* **Space Efficiency:** Optimize screen space by hiding secondary navigation or content behind a collapsible panel. Provide a compact and unobtrusive way to present additional options or functionality.

* **Hidden Accessibility:** Hide the drawer UI by default, to reduce visual information, to enable users to focus on the primary content. Users can access the hidden panel by swiping or tapping.

* **Smooth Interaction:** Ensure the interaction with a drawer is smooth and animated, providing a visually pleasing experience when the drawer slides into view, and slides out of view.

* **Flexibility and Customization:** Customize the drawer to match the overall design aesthetic of the application, such as the style and layout of the panel, and the triggering mechanism.

* **Content Organization:** Organize secondary navigation items, settings, filters, or additional actions. By grouping related options within the drawer, designers can create a more structured and organized UI.

* **Contextual Relevance:** Potentialy customize the drawer to display different options or content based on the current context or user interaction. This enhances usability and reduces cognitive load.
