# Drawer UI

A drawer user interface, also known as a slide-out menu or navigation panel, is a graphical control that provides a hidden panel that can be revealed by sliding it into view from the edge of the screen. It is commonly used in mobile and web applications to display additional navigation options or content without taking up much screen space.

Key characteristicsâ€¦

Space Efficiency: Optimize screen space by hiding secondary navigation or content behind a collapsible panel. Provide a compact and unobtrusive way to present additional options or functionality.

Smooth Interaction: Ensure the interaction with a drawer is smooth and animated, providing a visually pleasing experience whtn the drawer slides into view, and slides out of view.

Flexibility and Customization: Customize the drawer to match the overall design aesthetic of the application, such as the style and layout of the panel, and the triggering mechanism.
