# Ribbon UI

A ribbon user interface is a graphical control that presents a set of commands or actions in a horizontal bar across the top of an application or document. The ribbon control is often used in productivity software, to provide a visually organized and easily accessible set of tools and options to users.

Key characteristicsâ€¦

Grouping: Organize commands and actions into logical groups, such as formatting options, editing tools, or document-related functions. Each group is visually distinct, often represented by icons or text labels, making it easier for users to find and select the desired command.

Discoverability: Improve discoverability by presenting a wide range of available commands in a visible and accessible manner. Users can quickly scan the ribbon to locate specific functions or explore related features within the grouped sections.

Visual Hierarchy and Priority: Establish a visual hierarchy among commands and actions. Frequently used or primary commands can be placed in prominent locations or given larger icons, while less frequently used options can be grouped together or positioned in less prominent areas.

Contextual Tool Sets: Adapt and display different sets of commands or tools based on the context of the user's actions. Context-awareness provides a more focused and relevant set of tools to users at any given time.

Customizability: Potentially enable users to customize the ribbon control by adding or removing commands, rearranging groups, or creating custom tabs. This flexibility enables users to tailor the UI to their specific needs, improving efficiency and personalization.
