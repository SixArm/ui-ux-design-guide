**Key aspects:**

* **Aesthetic-Usability Effect:** Aesthetically pleasing designs are perceived as more usable and effective.

* **Feedback:** Provide clear immediate feedback to users to confirm their actions or inform them about the system's status.

* **Fitts's Law:** The time required to reach a target is based on the target's size and distance, helping inform the placement and sizing of interactive elements.

* **Hierarchy:** Design visual elements to create a clear hierarchy of importance, guiding users' attention and understanding.

* **Mapping:** The relationship between controls and their effects should be intuitive and closely aligned to the user's mental model.

* **Progressive Disclosure:** Present information and functionality in a way that reveals complexity gradually, allowing users to focus on the most relevant information first.

* **Simplicity:** Strive for simplicity in design by removing unnecessary complexity and clutter. Make the user experience more intuitive and efficient.

* **Error Prevention:** Design to minimize the occurrence of errors. Provide safeguards or warnings when errors may occur.
