# Cognitive load - recommendations

Reducing cognitive load in product design makes the user experience more efficient and enjoyable, and also increases the likelihood of users successfully completing tasks and returning to the product. It is a fundamental aspect of creating user-friendly and intuitive interfaces.

Recommendationsâ€¦

Simplify and Streamline: Minimize complexity and simplify tasks and processes. Remove unnecessary steps and information.

Use Clear and Consistent Design: Maintain a consistent and intuitive user interface. Use familiar design patterns and terminology.

Plan Effective Information Hierarchy: Organize information logically, with important information and actions prominently displayed. Use visual cues like headings, lists, and color to guide users.

Provide Feedback and Guidance: Provide clear feedback on user actions and errors. Offer guidance and tooltips when necessary.

Leverage Progressive Disclosure: Present information and options gradually, only when needed. Avoid overwhelming users with too many choices or details at once.

Prioritize Content: Focus on the most important content or actions and de-emphasize less important elements. Users should be able to quickly discern what's relevant.

Test Usability: Conduct usability testing with real users to identify areas of high cognitive load and gather feedback for improvements.
