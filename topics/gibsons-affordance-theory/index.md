# Gibson's affordance theory

Gibson's affordance theory, developed by psychologist James J. Gibson, is a framework that explains how humans perceive and interact with their environment. Affordances are the perceived possibilities for action that the environment offers to an individual. Gibson's affordance theory has had a significant impact on various fields, including psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, UI/UX, and design.

Key pointsâ€¦

* Perception-Action Coupling: Gibson proposed that perception and action are closely coupled. Perception is not simply the passive reception of sensory information but an active process that involves perceiving opportunities for action in the environment.

* Direct Perception: Gibson argued for the concept of direct perception, which suggests that perceptual information is rich and informative enough for individuals to directly perceive the affordances in their environment without the need for complex cognitive processes or internal representations.

* Environmental Properties: Affordances are determined by the properties and characteristics of the environment. For example, a chair affords sitting, a doorknob affords grasping and turning, and a staircase affords climbing. Affordances can be both physical and social in nature, as they encompass the physical properties of objects and also the social cues and invitations for action in a social context.

* Situated Action: Gibson emphasized the importance of the ecological context in which perception and action occur. Affordances are context-dependent, and individuals perceive different affordances in different situations. The meaning and relevance of affordances are shaped by the goals, intentions, and cultural norms of the individual within their specific environment.
