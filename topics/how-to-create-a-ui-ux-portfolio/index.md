# How to create a UI/UX portfolio

Your UI/UX portfolio should showcase your skills, and also tell a compelling story of your design journey, and demonstrate your ability to solve real-world problems through effective UI/UX design. Before finalizing your portfolio, seek feedback from peers, mentors, or professionals in the field.

Showcase Your Best Work: Select your most impressive and diverse projects to showcase in your portfolio. Include a variety of design styles, platforms, devices, and industries.

Provide Case Studies: For each project, include detailed case studies that outline the problem, your design process, and the solutions you implemented. Explain your design decisions.

Highlight Your Role: Clearly mention your role and contributions in each project, whether it was UI design, UX research, interaction design, or any other specific area of expertise.

Include Visual Assets: Showcase your designs using high-quality visuals, including screenshots, mockups, and prototypes, interactive elements, and animations.

Demonstrate User-Centered Design: Emphasize your understanding of user-centered design principles. Explain how you conducted user research, gathered user feedback, and iterated on your designs.

Display Your Design Process: Provide glimpses of your design process, including sketches, wireframes, and iterations. This demonstrates your ability to think critically, iterate on designs, and solve complex design problems.

Highlight Collaboration: If you have worked in a team setting, highlight your collaboration skills and experience working with developers, product managers, or other designers.
