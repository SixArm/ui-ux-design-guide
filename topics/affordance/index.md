# Affordance

Affordance is a concept in design and psychology that refers to the perceived and intuitive relationship between an object or element and its potential actions or uses. It describes the qualities or attributes of an object that suggest how it can or should be interacted with.

**Two types**:

* **Perceptible Affordances**: These are physical or visual characteristics of an object that convey its potential uses or interactions. For example, a round doorknob affords grasping and turning, while a flat surface affords pushing. Buttons with a raised appearance or distinct shape afford pressing.

* **Hidden or Implied Affordances**: These are qualities or cues that are not immediately visible but can be inferred through past experiences or cultural conventions. For example, a flat icon on a touchscreen may imply that it can be tapped or swiped. Similarly, underlined text in a document may imply that it is a hyperlink.

Affordances provide users with cues or signals about how they can interact with a physical object, digital interface, or any designed artifact. However, it's important to note that affordances can sometimes be misleading or ambiguous, leading to usability issues. Clear and well-designed affordances can enhance the usability and learnability of a product or interface, while ambiguous or misleading affordances can cause confusion and frustration.

Affordances help bridge the gap between a user's goals or intentions and the actions they need to perform to achieve those goals. They provide visual or sensory cues that guide users to interact with objects or interfaces in a way that aligns with their expectations.
