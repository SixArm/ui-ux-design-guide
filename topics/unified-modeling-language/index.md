# Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a visual language used for modeling software systems. It is a standardized notation that helps developers, architects, and other stakeholders to communicate and visualize the structure, behavior, and relationships of different components in a software system.

**Diagrams:**

* **Sequence diagram:** Represent the interaction between the objects of the system, to describe the behavior of the system.

* **Use Case diagram:** Represent the interaction between the system and its users, to describe system functionality.

* **Activity diagram:** Represent the flow of control in the system, to describe system behavior.

* **State diagram:** Represent the states and transitions of an system, to describe the behavior of the system.

* **Deployment diagram:** Represent the physical deployment of the system on hardware, to describe the deployment architecture of the system.

* **Class diagram:** Represent the classes, interfaces, and their relationships, to describe the structure of the system.

* **Object diagram:** Represent objects and their relationships, to verify the system design.

* **Package diagram:** Organize the elements of a system into packages, to show dependencies among packages and their contents.

* **Component diagram:** Represent the physical components of a system, to show the interfaces and dependencies among components.
