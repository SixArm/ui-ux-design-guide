# Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a visual language used for modeling software systems. It is a standardized notation that helps developers, architects, and other stakeholders to communicate and visualize the structure, behavior, and relationships of different components in a software system.

UML diagrams includeâ€¦

Sequence Diagram: This diagram represents the interaction between the objects of the system. It is used to describe the behavior of the system.

Use Case Diagram: This diagram represents the interaction between the system and its users. It is used to describe system functionality.

Activity Diagram: This diagram represents the flow of control in the system. It is used to describe system behavior.

State Diagram: This diagram represents the states and transitions of an system. It is used to describe the behavior of the system.

Deployment Diagram: This diagram represents the physical deployment of the system on hardware. It is used to describe the deployment architecture of the system.

Class Diagram: This diagram represents the classes, interfaces, and their relationships. It is used to describe the structure of the system.

Object diagram: The object diagram is used to represent a snapshot of the system at a particular point in time. It shows the objects and their relationships, and it can be used to test and verify design.

Package diagram: The package diagram is used to organize the elements of a system into packages. It shows the dependencies between the packages and their contents.

Component diagram: The component diagram is used to represent the physical components of a system. It shows the interfaces and dependencies between the components.
