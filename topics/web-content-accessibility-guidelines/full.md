# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provide recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The guidelines aim to ensure that web content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

WCAG consists of four main principles:

* Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presented in a way that users can perceive them. This includes providing alternatives for non-text content (such as images or videos) for people who cannot see them, ensuring that text is readable and understandable, and making sure that content is easily distinguishable from the background.

* Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable by users. This means that users should be able to interact with all the functionality using various input methods (such as keyboard, mouse, or touch), providing enough time for users to read and use content, and ensuring that navigation and interactive elements are easy to understand and use.

* Understandable: Web content and its operation must be understandable to users. This involves making text and content clear and easy to read, using plain language and avoiding jargon or complex terminology, providing instructions and feedback in a clear and concise manner, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.

* Robust: Web content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide range of user agents (such as browsers, assistive technologies, and other user interfaces). This includes using standard HTML, CSS, and other web technologies correctly, ensuring compatibility with different browsers and devices, and avoiding relying on specific technologies or features that may limit accessibility.

Each of these principles is further divided into specific guidelines, which are then broken down into success criteria. The success criteria are organized into three levels of conformance: A (the lowest level), AA, and AAA (the highest level). The higher the level of conformance, the more accessible the web content becomes.

It's important to note that WCAG guidelines are not legally binding, but they are widely recognized and adopted as the standard for web accessibility. Many countries, organizations, and industries have incorporated WCAG into their accessibility policies and regulations to ensure equal access to digital content for all individuals.
