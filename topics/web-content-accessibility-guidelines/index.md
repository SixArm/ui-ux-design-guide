# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The guidelines aim to ensure that web content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Success criteria are organized into three levels of conformance: A (low), AA (medium), and AAA (high).

WCAG four main principlesâ€¦

Perceivable: Present information and user interface components in ways that users can perceive them. Provide alternatives for non-text content (such as images or videos) for people who cannot see them. Ensure text is readable and understandable. Ensure content is easily distinguishable from the background.

Operable: Ensure user interface components and navigation are operable by users. Users must be able to interact with all the functionality using various input methods (such as keyboard, mouse, or touch), with enough time for users to read and use content.

Understandable: Make web content and its operation understandable to users. Make text and content clear and easy to read. Use plain language and avoid jargon or complex terminology. Provide instructions and feedback in a clear and concise manner. Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

Robust: Make web content interpretable reliably by a wide range of user agents (such as browsers, assistive technologies, and other user interfaces). Use standard HTML, CSS, and other web technologies correctly. Ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices. Avoid relying on specific technologies or features that may limit accessibility.
