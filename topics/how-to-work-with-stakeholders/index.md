* **Understand Expectations:** Conduct stakeholder analysis to gather information about their goals, motivations, and potential risks.

* **Communicate Regularly:** Maintain open transparent communication with stakeholders throughout the project. Clearly convey expectations, updates, progress, challenges, and decisions.

* **Build Relationships:** Foster trust and build positive relationships with stakeholders. Be reliable, responsive, and follow through on your commitments.

* **Involve Stakeholders:** Include stakeholders in decision-making processes when possible, such as through workshops, focus groups, or collaborations. Seek their input, opinions, and feedback.

* **Resolve Conflicts:** Act as a mediator when conflicts arise, facilitating constructive discussions and finding win-win solutions. Address conflicts early before they escalate.

* **Provide Value:** Demonstrate the value and benefits of the project to stakeholders, such as via showcases, demos, and updates. Clearly communicate how the project aligns with their objectives

* **Be Adaptable:** Recognize that stakeholder needs and priorities may evolve throughout the project. Be flexible and adaptable in response to changing stakeholder requirements.
