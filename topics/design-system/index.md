# Design system

A design system is a collection of guidelines, principles, and reusable components that help maintain consistency and cohesion in the design of digital products or services. It serves as a central resource that defines the visual and interactive elements, patterns, and rules to be followed when creating user interfaces. A design system helps improve UI/UX consistency, efficiency, scalability, and collaboration.

A design system typically includesâ€¦

Design Principles: These are overarching guidelines that inform the design decisions and provide a framework for creating a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Visual Style Guide: It outlines the visual elements such as typography, colors, iconography, spacing, and imagery that should be used consistently throughout the product.

Component Library: This includes reusable UI components like buttons, forms, navigation menus, cards, and other interface elements. These help create consistent efficient user interfaces.

Interaction Patterns: This includes practices for navigation, gestures, animations, wizards, and other interactivity. These help ensure a predictable and intuitive user experience.

Accessibility Guidelines: These guidelines ensure that the design system adheres to accessibility standards for a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation accompanies the design system, providing guidelines, usage examples, code snippets, and explanations to help stakeholders use the design system effectively.
