# User-centered design (UCD)

User-centered design (UCD) is an approach to designing products, systems, or interfaces that places the needs, goals, and preferences of the end users at the forefront of the design process. It involves understanding the users through research and iterative testing, and using that knowledge to guide design decisions. Benefits include improved user satisfaction, enhanced usability, reduced development costs, and ultimately a competitive advantage.

Key principlesâ€¦

User Involvement: Emphasize involving users throughout the design process. Achieve this via techniques such as user research, user interviews, surveys, and usability testing. Gain insights into user needs, preferences, and pain points. Consider factors such as the physical environment, user characteristics, technological constraints, and social or cultural influences.

User Goals: Focus on understanding the goals that users want to accomplish with the system, and the context in which the product will be used, to ensure that the design supports users in achieving their objectives correctly and efficiently.

Design for Usability: Create prototypes or mock-ups of the product or interface, conduct usability testing, gather user feedback, and incorporate finding. Create designs that are intuitive, easy to learn, efficient to use, and error-resistant. Focus on a positive user experience by designing interfaces that support users in accomplishing their tasks with minimal effort.

Multidisciplinary Collaboration: Collaborate among designers, developers, researchers, and other stakeholders involved in the design process. Bring together diverse perspectives and expertise, to create designs that meet the needs of the users while also considering technical feasibility and business goals.
