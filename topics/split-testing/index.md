# Split testing

Split testing, also known as A/B testing, is a method used to compare two or more variations of a webpage, interface, or marketing element to determine which one performs better in achieving a specific goal. It is a data-driven approach that helps optimize and improve the effectiveness of digital experiences by systematically testing different design, content, or functionality options.

The split testing process typically involves the following steps:

1. Goal Identification: Define the specific goal or metric that you want to improve or optimize. This could be increasing click-through rates, conversion rates, engagement, or any other measurable outcome.

2. Variations Creation: Create two or more versions of the element being tested, with each version representing a different variation.

3. Random Allocation: Randomly assign users or a subset of users to each variation. This helps ensure a fair distribution of users across the different variations and minimizes bias.

4. User Exposure: Expose each user to one of the variations when they interact with the webpage, interface, or marketing element.

5. Data Collection: Collect data on user interactions and behaviors for each variation. This can include metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, engagement time, or any other relevant data point.

6. Statistical Analysis: Analyze the collected data to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the variations in terms of the goal metric.
