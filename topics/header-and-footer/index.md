# Header and footer

A header and footer are two essential components of a website's layout that appear consistently across multiple pages.

* Header: The header is located at the top of the web page and typically contains branding elements, the website's logo, and primary navigation menus. It serves as a visual identifier for the website and allows users to navigate to different sections or pages of the site. The header may also include search bars, contact information, social media icons, or other relevant elements that facilitate user interaction and engagement.

* Footer: The footer is positioned at the bottom of the web page and often contains secondary navigation menus, copyright information, legal disclaimers, links to important pages (such as privacy policy or terms of service), and contact details. The footer is typically less prominent than the header but still serves as a navigational aid and provides additional information or links for users.

**Key aspects**:

Consistency: The header and footer are consistent elements that appear across all pages of a website. This helps users navigate easily and find information regardless of their location within the website.

Aesthetics: The header and footer contribute to the overall design and aesthetics of a website. They can be customized to match the website's visual style and create a cohesive user experience.

SEO and Conversion Opportunities: The header and footer offer opportunities to include relevant keywords, optimize internal linking, and improve search engine optimization (SEO). The header and footer can be used to include calls-to-action (CTAs) or links to encourage user engagement, conversions, or sign-ups.
