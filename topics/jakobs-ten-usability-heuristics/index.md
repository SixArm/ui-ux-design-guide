# Jakob’s Ten Usability Heuristics

1. **Visibility of System Status**: Designs should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate, timely feedback.

2. **Match between System and the Real World**: Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.

3. **User Control and Freedom**: Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action.

4. **Consistency and Standards**: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

5. **Error Prevention**: Good error messages are important, and good designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.

6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**: Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. Avoid making users remember information.

7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**: Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user.

8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information.

9. **Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

10. **Help and Documentation**: It’s best if the design doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users complete their tasks.
