# Benchmark testing

Benchmark testing, also known as benchmarking, is the process of comparing the performance of a computer system, software application, or other technology against a standard or reference point. The goal of benchmark testing is to evaluate the speed, efficiency, and overall performance of a system or application, and to identify areas for improvement. It is important to choose appropriate benchmarks and testing methods and to interpret the results carefully, as they may not always be directly comparable or indicative of real-world performance.

Common types of benchmark testingâ€¦

Performance testing: This involves testing the performance of a system or application under different conditions and workloads.

Performance regression testing: This involves testing the performance of a system or application after changes or updates have been made.

Load testing: This involves testing the ability of a system or application to handle a large amount of traffic or activity.

Stress testing: This involves testing the ability of a system or application to handle extreme conditions or situations.

Compatibility testing: This involves testing the compatibility of a system or application with different operating systems, devices, or software environments.
