# High-fidelity prototype

A high-fidelity prototype is a detailed and interactive representation of a design that closely resembles the final product or application. It includes all the visual and functional elements of the final product, such as colors, fonts, images, layout, and user interactions.

High-fidelity prototypes can be created using various tools such as design software, web development frameworks, or specialized prototyping tools. They require a higher level of technical expertise and take more time and resources to create than low-fidelity prototypes.

Examples:

* Physical products: A fabricated model that is near the correct size, shape, color, weight, and usability. The model is used for functional testing, market research, and even for creating mold patterns for mass production.

* Websites and mobile applications: An interactive user interface, realistic imagery, legible content, navigation menus, clickable buttons, and followable links.

* Games, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR): high-quality graphics, interactive environments, sound effects, and immersive user experiences.

High-fidelity prototypes are useful for testing the functionality and usability of a product before it goes into development. They help identify potential issues and provide a more realistic user experience for testing. They can also be used for stakeholder presentations and demonstrations, as they provide a more accurate representation of the final product.

High-fidelity prototypes are an essential part of the design process, as they allow designers and stakeholders to test and refine the product before it goes into development, ultimately saving time and resources in the long run.
