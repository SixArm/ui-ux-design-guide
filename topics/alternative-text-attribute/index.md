# Alternative text attribute

In web design and accessibility, the "alt" attribute (short for alternative text) is used to provide a text alternative for images. It is an important accessibility feature that allows users who are visually impaired or using assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to understand and interpret the content of an image.

**Key aspects:**

* **Text Alternative:** The alt attribute allows you to describe the content and purpose of an image in text format. This description should be concise, accurate, and meaningful. It should convey the same message or convey the intended context that the image is trying to communicate.

* **Accessibility Compliance:** Providing alt text for images is a requirement for web accessibility compliance, as specified by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Including alt attributes ensures that your website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments.

* **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Screen readers are assistive technologies that read aloud the content of a web page to individuals who are visually impaired. When an image contains an alt attribute, the screen reader can read the alternative text.

* **SEO Benefits:** Alt text also serves a search engine optimization (SEO) purpose. Search engines rely on alt text to understand and index images, which can improve the visibility and ranking of your web pages in search results.

* **Image Loading Failure:** In cases where an image fails to load due to slow connections, broken links, or browser issues, the alt attribute serves as a fallback. Instead of a broken or missing image, users will see the alternative text, providing them with some context.
