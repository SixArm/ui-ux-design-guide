# The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman

"The Design of Everyday Things" is a book written by Donald Norman, a cognitive scientist and usability engineer. It explores the fundamental principles of design and usability, focusing on how the design of everyday objects and systems can either enhance or hinder their usability and user experience.

**Key aspects**:

Discoverability: The ease with which users can understand and discover the functions and features of an object or system. Norman emphasizes the importance of providing clear and intuitive cues to help users.

Mapping: The relationship between controls and their effect. Norman discusses how effective mapping can reduce cognitive load and improve user understanding by aligning the controls with expected outcomes.

Affordances: The provision of feedback to users about the status and outcomes of their actions. Norman explains how well-designed feedback and affordances can guide users and their interactions.

Conceptual Models: The mental representations that users develop to understand how a system or object works. Norman explores the importance of aligning the conceptual model with the system's actual behavior.

Error Handling: Norman discusses the significance of designing error messages that provide meaningful information, as well as implementing systems that minimize the likelihood of errors in the first place.

Human-Centered Design: The approach of designing products and systems that prioritize the needs, capabilities, and limitations of users. Norman emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding user behavior and mental models when designing for usability.
