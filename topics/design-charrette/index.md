# Design charrette

A design charrette is a collaborative, intensive, and time-limited design process that brings together a group of designers, stakeholders, and subject matter experts to generate ideas, explore solutions, and develop a plan for a specific project or problem.

The goal is to produce a comprehensive, cohesive, and innovative design solution that meets the needs of all stakeholders. Key benefits include improving collaboration, innovation, efficiency, and engagement.

Typical steps:

1. Problem definition: The group defines the problem or challenge that the design charrette will address, and identifies the stakeholders who will be involved.

2. Research and preparation: Participants conduct research and gather information about the project or problem, and prepare design concepts and ideas to bring to the charrette.

3. Ideation: The group engages in brainstorming and idea generation, exploring a wide range of design solutions and approaches.

4. Concept development: Participants refine and develop their design concepts, exploring the feasibility and practicality of different approaches.

5. Review and feedback: The group reviews and critiques each other's design concepts, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement.

6. Integration and synthesis: Participants work together to integrate their design concepts into a cohesive plan that addresses all aspects of the project or problem.

7. Presentation and communication: The group presents their design solution to the stakeholders, communicating the rationale behind their approach and seeking feedback.
