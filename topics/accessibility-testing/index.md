# Accessibility testing

Accessibility testing is the process of evaluating a website, application, or program to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. The goal is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their ability, can use the application or website without any barriers.

Accessibility testing helps to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to digital services and content, and it can also help businesses avoid potential legal issues related to accessibility.

**Key aspects:**

* **Compliance with Accessibility Standards**: Accessibility standards are a set of guidelines and rules that are designed to ensure that digital content and services are accessible to people with disabilities. Common accessibility standards include the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act.

* **User Testing**: User testing involves working with people with disabilities to evaluate the accessibility of an application or website. This can help identify potential barriers or issues that may not be apparent during other types of testing.

* **Automated Testing**: Automated testing involves using software tools to test an application or website for accessibility issues. These tools can help identify issues related to color contrast, font size, and other factors that may impact accessibility.

* **Manual Testing**: Manual testing involves evaluating an application or website for accessibility issues using a combination of human expertise and software tools. Manual testing is often used in conjunction with other types of testing to ensure that all potential accessibility issues are identified and addressed.
