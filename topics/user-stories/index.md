# User stories

A user story is a technique used in software development to capture a description of a feature from the user's perspective. It is a short, simple statement that describes a user's need or requirement for a product or system. User stories are often used in Agile software development, where they are used as a basis for planning and prioritizing work.

A user story typically follows a simple format, consisting of three parts: a persona or user, a need or requirement, and a goal or outcome. For example, a user story for an e-commerce website might read: "As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history so that I can track my purchases and returns."

User stories are designed to be simple and easy to understand, and are often written in a way that can be easily communicated to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. They are intended to serve as a reminder of the user's perspective throughout the development process, and help to ensure that the product being developed meets the user's needs and expectations.

User stories are typically organized and prioritized using a product backlog, which is a list of all the features or requirements that need to be developed for a product or system. The product backlog is often prioritized based on the value that each user story provides to the user or customer, with the most valuable stories being developed first.
