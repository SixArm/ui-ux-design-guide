# Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA)

Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) is a research methodology used to understand the cognitive processes and mental strategies that individuals employ while performing a task. CTA aims to uncover the knowledge, decision-making, problem-solving, and other cognitive activities involved in completing a task. The goal is to bridge the gap between observable behaviors and underlying cognitive processes.

**Key aspects**:

Interviews: Interview subject matter experts and experienced individuals who perform the task. Use open-ended questions to learn about thought processes, decision-making strategies, problem-solving techniques, and other task-relevant cognitive aspects.

Think-Aloud Protocol: Ask participant to verbalize their thoughts and actions while performing the task. They express their thinking process, observations, decisions, and reasoning out loud.

Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA): Examine the interplay between the individual's cognitive processes, the social and organizational context, and the task. Focus on the mental models, strategies, and knowledge structures that individuals use.

Knowledge Elicitation Techniques: Extract explicit and tacit knowledge via methods like knowledge maps, concept mapping, or decision trees. Capture the cognitive structures and relationships between different pieces of knowledge relevant to the task.

Cognitive Task Interviews: Present participants with specific task scenarios. Potentially use a simulation. Probe for thought processes, problem-solving approaches, decision-making strategies, and task-relevant cognitive aspects.

Cognitive Workload Assessment: Measure the cognitive workload experienced by individuals while performing a task. Methods include subjective ratings, physiological measures, and performance measures.
