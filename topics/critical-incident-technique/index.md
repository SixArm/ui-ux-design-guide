# Critical Incident Technique (CIT)

The Critical Incident Technique (CIT) is a qualitative research method used to gather detailed and specific information about significant events or incidents that have occurred in a particular context.
The primary objective is to extract valuable insights and actionable knowledge from real-life events that can inform decision-making, problem-solving, training, or process improvement efforts.

**General process:**

1. **Define:** Clearly define what constitutes a critical incident within the context, such as within a specific job role, task, customer interaction, or any other relevant domain.

2. **Collect:** Gather details of critical incidents from individuals who have experienced them. Do this via interviews, surveys, reports, etc. Cover what happened, who was involved, actions taken, and outcomes.

3. **Select:** Choose a subset of incidents that are most critical or representative of the phenomenon, and that cover a range of outcomes, highlight different aspects of the context, or provide rich insights.

4. **Code:** Analyze each selected incident and identify themes, patterns, or factors that emerge from the narratives. Code the incidents by tagging relevant concepts or categories that capture the essence.

5. **Cluster:** Identify commonalities, differences, trends, recurring themes, critical behaviors, environmental factors, or decision points that are associated with the outcomes. Extract insights and actionable knowledge.

6. **Interpret:** Draw conclusions based on the identified factors, patterns, or themes. These findings can inform decision-making, process improvement, training programs, or other relevant actions. Validate  findings with stakeholders or subject matter experts.
