# End-to-end testing

End-to-end testing is a type of software testing that is designed to verify that an application or system is functioning as expected from beginning to end. This testing method is used to test the functionality of an application or system as it would be used by a real user. It involves testing the application's user interface, all the different components and modules of the system, and the integration between these components.

End-to-end testing is performed to ensure that the application or system is functioning properly and meeting the user's needs. The testing is done from the user's perspective, meaning that it is designed to simulate how a user would interact with the application or system. The testing is typically performed after unit testing and integration testing have been completed.

End-to-end testing can be performed manually or using automated testing tools. Automated testing tools are often used because they can perform the tests faster and more accurately than manual testing. These tools can simulate user interactions with the application or system, and they can verify that the system is behaving as expected.

The goal of end-to-end testing is to catch defects early in the software development life cycle, before they can affect the end user. It can help to identify issues with the application or system, such as broken links, performance problems, and functional issues. By testing the entire system, end-to-end testing can ensure that all the different components of the system are working together as expected and delivering the desired results.
