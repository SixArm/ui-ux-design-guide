# Tree UI

A tree user interface is a graphical control that displays hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. It allows users to navigate and interact with a hierarchical set of items or categories, typically represented as nodes and branches. Tree controls are commonly used in various applications, including file explorers, project management tools, organizational charts, and content management systems.
