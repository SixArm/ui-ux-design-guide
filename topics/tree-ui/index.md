# Tree UI

A tree user interface is a graphical control that displays hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. It allows users to navigate and interact with a hierarchical set of items or categories, typically represented as nodes and branches. Tree controls are commonly used in various applications, including file explorers, project management tools, organizational charts, and content management systems.

**Key aspects:**

* **Hierarchical Data Representation:** Represent hierarchical data, where items or categories have parent-child relationships. Organize data, showing the relationships between different levels of information.

* **Expandable and Collapsible Nodes:** Enable users to expand or collapse branches to reveal or hide sub-levels of information. This lets users to focus on specific sections of the tree and navigate through the data efficiently.

* **Visual Hierarchy:** Use indentation and visual cues such as lines or connectors to convey the hierarchical structure and relationships between nodes.

* **Contextual Menu and Actions:** Potentially provide context-specific actions or menus that users can access by right-clicking on a node. These menus allow users to perform operations on the selected item, such as editing, deleting, or creating new child nodes.

* **Search and Filtering:** Potentially provide search and filtering functionality to help users quickly find specific items within the tree. Users can enter keywords or criteria to filter the displayed nodes based on their search terms.

* **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Potentially support drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to rearrange nodes or move them between different levels in the hierarchy. This feature provides a flexible and intuitive way to manage the structure of the tree.
