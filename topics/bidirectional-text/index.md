# Bidirectional text (bidi)

Bidirectional (bidi) text refers to text that combines both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) scripts within the same line or paragraph. This is commonly found in languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu, where the writing direction alternates between RTL and LTR scripts.

Designing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX) that accommodate bidirectional text requires special considerations to ensure readability and proper alignment.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Text Direction: Ensure that LTR scripts and RTR are aligned and displayed correctly. The text direction should follow the natural reading order of the respective languages.

Layout and Alignment: Adapt the layout and alignment of UI elements to support bidirectional text. For example, in RTL, element alignment may be mirrored compared to LTR.

Typography and Font Selection: Choose fonts that support bidirectional text rendering. Ensure the fonts handle both LTR and RTL scripts effectively and maintain readability.

Interaction and Navigation: Consider the impact of bidirectional text on interaction and navigation elements. For example, ensure that indicators are positioned correctly based on the text direction.

Text Editing and Input: Provide a text input and editing experience that accommodates bidirectional text. Allow users to switch between LTR and RTL input modes as necessary. Ensure that the cursor and text selection behavior follows the directionality.

Testing: When designing for bidirectional text, involve native speakers or experts of the target languages in the testing and feedback process.
