# Journeys

A user journey, also known as a customer journey, is a tool used in product design and development to map out the path that a user takes to complete a specific task or achieve a goal. It is a visual representation of the steps that a user goes through, from initial awareness of a product or service to the final outcome.

User journeys are often created in conjunction with user personas and are used to provide a better understanding of the user's experience when interacting with a product or service. They help designers and developers to identify pain points and areas for improvement, and to create a product that is user-focused and meets the needs of its intended audience.

A typical user journey includes a series of steps that a user takes to achieve their goal, from the initial trigger that leads them to seek out a product or service, to the final outcome. Each step in the journey is typically accompanied by a description of the user's actions, thoughts, and emotions, as well as any pain points or issues they encounter.

User journeys can be created through a process of user research, which may include interviews, surveys, and other forms of data collection. The data collected is then analyzed to identify patterns and trends, which are used to create the user journey.

User journeys are an important tool in product design and development, as they help to ensure that the product is user-focused and meets the needs of its intended audience. They provide a clear understanding of the user's experience when interacting with a product or service, which can be used to inform design decisions and create a product that is easy to use and provides value to its users.
