# How to lead a meeting

Leading a meeting effectively involves careful planning, facilitation skills, and the ability to keep participants engaged and focused.

* **Define the Purpose:** Determine the meeting objectives, and an agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed, along with times for each topic. Share the agenda with participants in advance.

* **Prepare Meeting Materials:** Gather and prepare any necessary materials, documents, or presentations that will be used during the meeting. Ensure these materials are organized and  accessible.

* **Start with an Introduction:** Begin the meeting by welcoming participants and providing a brief overview of the agenda and meeting objectives. Introduce any new attendees.

* **Facilitate Discussion:** As the meeting progresses, guide the discussion and ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. Encourage active participation.

* **Encourage Collaboration:** Foster a environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives.

* **Manage Time:** Start on time. End on time. Focus on the agenda. Defer/delegate aspects as needed. Schedule follow-ups as needed.

* **Manage Conflict:** If disagreements arise, address them calmly and respectfully. Encourage dialogue, seek common ground, and find solutions or compromises.

* **Close the Meeting:** Summarize the outcomes and action items. Thank participants. Do follow-up  communication to all participants with the summary and any relevant resources.
