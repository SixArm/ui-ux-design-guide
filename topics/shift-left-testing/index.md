# Shift-left testing

Shift-left testing is an approach to software quality assurance that involves identifying and fixing defects early in the development process. The goal of shift-left testing is to move testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle, rather than waiting until the end of the development cycle to test the code. This approach enables developers to identify and fix defects before they become more costly and time-consuming to fix later in the development process.

The term "shift-left" refers to the idea of shifting the testing process to the left on a timeline of the software development process. In traditional software development, testing is often performed after development is complete, or "shifted right" on the timeline. However, shift-left testing involves testing the code as it is being written, ensuring that defects are detected and corrected as soon as possible.

Shift-left testing can include a variety of techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, UI/UX testing, localization testing, and more.

Shift-left testing also involves using tools and techniques that support early detection of defects. For example, code reviews and static analysis tools can help identify defects in the code before it is tested. Continuous integration and continuous testing can help detect defects early in the development process, ensuring that they are fixed before they impact the quality of the final product.

Overall, shift-left testing is a powerful approach to software quality assurance that can help reduce the cost and time associated with fixing defects later in the development process. By focusing on detecting and fixing defects early, shift-left testing can help ensure that the final product meets the desired quality standards.
