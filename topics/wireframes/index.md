# Wireframes

Wireframes are a type of visual design representation used in the early stages of product development, particularly in software design. They are essentially a low-fidelity blueprint of a user interface (UI) that represents the basic layout and structure of a web page, application, or other digital product.

Wireframes are created to help design teams conceptualize and plan the layout and flow of a product, and to communicate this information to other stakeholders such as developers, project managers, and clients. They are typically created using simple lines and shapes, and can be produced using a range of tools, from pen and paper to specialized software.

Wireframes help designers to determine the optimal placement of content and functionality, and to explore different options before committing to a particular design. They can be used to test user flow, navigation, and interactions, and to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.

Wireframes are often created in conjunction with other design elements such as user personas, user journeys, and visual design concepts. They are an important step in the design process, allowing designers to create a functional, user-friendly product that meets the needs of their target audience.
