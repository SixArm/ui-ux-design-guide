# Diary study

A diary study is a research method used to collect qualitative data about individuals' experiences, behaviors, and thoughts over a specific period of time. It involves participants keeping a record, often in the form of a diary or journal, of their activities, emotions, and other relevant information. Diary studies are particularly useful when studying phenomena that unfold over time or when exploring people's thoughts and experiences within their own context.

General overviewâ€¦

Recruitment: Identify and recruit participants who are willing to keep a diary and provide regular entries. Participation can vary depending on the research goals and available resources.

Guidelines: Provide instructions on what to record in the diaries, such as documenting specific events, activities, emotions, or any other aspects relevant to the study.

Diary Keeping: Participants are expected to record entries in their diaries regularly, often on a daily or weekly basis, depending on the study's duration. The entries can be in written form, audio recordings, or even multimedia formats, depending on the study design.

Data Collection: Once participants have completed the diary keeping period, researchers collect the diaries and associated materials from the participants. They may also conduct additional interviews or surveys to gather more context or clarify certain aspects of the diary entries.

Data Analysis: Researchers analyze the diary entries and other collected data using qualitative analysis methods. They look for patterns, themes, and insights to gain a deeper understanding of participants' experiences, behaviors, or attitudes.

Reporting: The results of the diary study are interpreted and summarized, and the findings are presented in research papers, reports, or other relevant formats. Researchers may also use quotes or excerpts from the diaries to illustrate key points.
