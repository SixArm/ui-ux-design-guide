# Diary study

A diary study is a research method used to collect qualitative data about individuals' experiences, behaviors, and thoughts over a specific period of time. It involves participants keeping a record, often in the form of a diary or journal, of their activities, emotions, and other relevant information. Diary studies are particularly useful when studying phenomena that unfold over time or when exploring people's thoughts and experiences within their own context.

**General overview:**

* **Recruitment:** Identify and recruit participants who are willing to keep a diary and provide regular entries. Participation can vary depending on the research goals and available resources.

* **Guidelines:** Provide instructions on what to record in the diaries, such as documenting specific events, activities, emotions, or any other aspects relevant to the study.

* **Diary Keeping:** Participants record entries in their diaries, often on a daily or weekly basis, depending on the study's duration. Entries can be in written form, audio recordings, or even multimedia formats.

* **Data Collection:** Collect the diaries and associated materials from the participants. Conduct additional interviews or surveys to gather more context or clarify aspects of the diary entries.

* **Data Analysis:** Analyze entries and other collected data using qualitative analysis methods. Look for patterns, themes, and insights to gain a deeper understanding of participants' experiences, behaviors, or attitudes.

* **Reporting:** Interpret and summarize results. Present the findings in papers, reports, or other relevant formats. Use quotes or excerpts from the diaries to illustrate key points.
