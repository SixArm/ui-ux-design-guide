# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to ensure that the delivered software meets the business requirements. It involves the creation of a shared understanding of the project goals and the development of tests to ensure that the system behaves as expected. BDD is an extension of Test Driven Development (TDD), which focuses on unit testing, but BDD shifts the emphasis to behavior specification and documentation.

BDD follows a three-step process to define and implement the desired behavior of the system:

1. **Define** the behavior in scenarios.

2. **Implement** the code to support the scenarios.

3. **Validate** the implemented code against the scenarios.

This process ensures that the system is developed to meet the business requirements, and that the code is tested to ensure that it behaves as expected.

BDD focuses on defining the desired behavior of the system from the perspective of the business stakeholders. BDD typically uses a structured language to define the expected behavior of the system in terms of scenarios that describe the interactions between the system and its users.

BDD collaboration results in the creation of a shared understanding of the project goals and the development of tests that reflect the desired behavior of the system. BDD encourages developers to write code that is easy to read and maintain, and that is well-designed to meet the business requirements. It also helps to reduce the risk of defects and bugs, by identifying them early in the development cycle.
