# Accessibility

Accessibility refers to the design and development of products, services, environments, or digital content that can be used by individuals with disabilities. It aims to ensure that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and engage with information, technology, and physical spaces.

Benefits include improved user experience, inclusivity, legal and ethical compliance, expanded audience, and future-proofing.

Ensuring accessibility requires following established guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and conducting accessibility testing and audits.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Perceivability: Ensure that information can be perceived through multiple senses. For example, provide alternative text for images, captions for videos, clear and readable text, and color contrast.

Operability: Ensure that user interfaces can be operated by individuals with different abilities. For example, provide for keyboard-only access, screen readers, ARIA attributes, or assistive technologies.

Understandability: Ensure that content and functionality are presented in a clear and understandable manner. For example, use plain language, logical organization, and provide assistance to guide users.

Robustness: Ensure that system can be interpreted and accessed by a wide range of assistive technologies, devices, and platforms. Adhere to web standards, such as WCAG, alternate text attributes, and semantic markup.
