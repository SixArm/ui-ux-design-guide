# Design canvas

A design canvas in UI/UX design is a visual framework or template that helps designers organize and structure their thoughts, ideas, and design concepts. It serves as a tool to capture and communicate key aspects of a design project, providing a holistic view of the product or experience being designed.

Typical elementsâ€¦

Problem Statement: Define the problem or challenge that the design aims to solve. This helps align the design process with the project goals.

Personas: Describe the target audience or user groups, including their characteristics, demographics, needs, perspectives, motivations, and goals.

Journeys: Map out the user's journey or workflow, showing steps they take and touchpoints they encounter when interacting with the product or experience.

Information Architecture: Plan the structure and organization of information within the design, including content hierarchy, navigation, and layout.

Visual Design: Sketch or represent the layout, components, and visual elements of the design. This can includes wireframes, mockups, in low-fidelity and/or high-fidelity.

Interaction Design: Define how users interact with the design, including user flows, navigation patterns, and interactive elements.

Testing: Outline methods for evaluating and testing the design, such as usability testing, focus groups, feedback collection, behavioral analytics, or user research.
