# Focus group

A focus group is a qualitative research method used to gather opinions and attitudes from a small, diverse group of individuals about a particular product, service, concept, or topic. It typically involves bringing together 6 to 10 individuals who represent the target audience and who can provide valuable feedback on the subject being studied.

In a focus group, participants are asked open-ended questions or given specific tasks to complete to gather their opinions and insights. The discussion is led by a moderator who guides the conversation, encourages participation, and ensures that all participants have an opportunity to share their thoughts.

Focus groups are often used in market research to gather feedback on new products, services, or marketing campaigns before they are launched. The information gathered from a focus group can help companies identify consumer needs and preferences, as well as potential issues or concerns that need to be addressed.

There are several advantages to using focus groups as a research method. For example, focus groups allow for the gathering of detailed and in-depth information about a topic or product, as participants can share their thoughts and experiences in a group setting. Additionally, focus groups can provide insight into the reasons behind consumer behavior, as participants can share their motivations and attitudes.

However, there are also some limitations to focus groups. For example, the opinions and attitudes shared by participants may not be representative of the wider population, and group dynamics can influence the responses given. Additionally, the moderator's role can also have an impact on the results obtained, and there may be bias in the selection of participants or in the questions asked.
