# SCAMPER is a creative thinking technique used to stimulate idea generation and innovative problem-solving. It is an acronym that represents a set of prompts or strategies for examining existing ideas or concepts and transforming them into new and improved versions. Each letter in SCAMPER corresponds to a different prompt:

* Substitute: This prompt encourages you to consider substituting or replacing certain elements or components of an idea with something else. It involves identifying aspects that can be swapped or substituted to bring a fresh perspective or improved functionality.

* Combine: The combine prompt prompts you to explore the possibilities of merging or combining different elements or ideas together. It involves identifying how existing concepts or components can be brought together to create something new or synergistic.

* Adapt: The adapt prompt involves considering how an idea or concept can be adapted or modified to fit a different context or purpose. It encourages you to think about how existing solutions or approaches can be adjusted or tweaked to address new challenges or target different audiences.

* Modify: This prompt encourages you to think about making modifications or alterations to an idea or concept. It involves identifying aspects that can be changed, enhanced, or adjusted to improve functionality, aesthetics, or performance.

* Put to another use: This prompt involves exploring alternative applications or contexts for an existing idea or concept. It encourages you to think beyond the original purpose and identify new ways to utilize or repurpose existing elements or resources.

* Eliminate: The eliminate prompt prompts you to identify elements or components that can be removed or eliminated from an idea or concept. It involves simplifying or streamlining the concept by identifying non-essential or redundant aspects.

* Reverse: The reverse prompt involves flipping or reversing the traditional assumptions or perspectives associated with an idea or concept. It encourages you to think in the opposite direction or consider alternative viewpoints to gain new insights and generate innovative ideas.

By using SCAMPER, individuals or teams can systematically analyze and transform existing ideas or concepts, fostering creativity and generating novel solutions. The prompts serve as a guide to stimulate thinking from different angles, challenging assumptions, and unlocking new possibilities for innovation.
