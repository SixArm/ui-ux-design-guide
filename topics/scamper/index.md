# SCAMPER

SCAMPER is a creative thinking technique used to stimulate idea generation and innovative problem-solving. It is an acronym for prompts to examine existing ideas or concepts, and transform them into new and improved versions.

Substitute: Can you replace certain parts of an idea with something else? Can you identify aspects that can be swapped or substituted to bring a fresh perspective?

Combine: Can you merge different elements or ideas together? It involves identifying how existing concepts or components can be brought together to create something new or synergistic.

Adapt: Can you adapt or modify an idea to fit a different context or purpose? Can you think about how existing solutions or approaches can be adjusted or tweaked?

Modify: Can you alter an idea? Can you change, enhance, or adjust to improve functionality, aesthetics, or performance?

Put to another use: Can you find alternative applications or contexts for an existing idea or concept? Can you think beyond the original purpose and identify ways to repurpose?

Eliminate: Can you remove aspects from an idea? Can you simplify or streamline it?

Reverse: Can you flip any traditional assumptions or perspectives associated with an idea? Can you think in the opposite direction or consider alternative viewpoints to gain new insights?
