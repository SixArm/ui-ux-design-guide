# Progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement is an approach to web or user interface (UI) design and development that focuses on delivering a basic, functional experience to all users, then adding enhanced features and functionality for those with more advanced or capable devices.

**Key aspects:**

* **Core Functionality:** Ensure the core functionality of the system is usable by all users. Ensure proper semantic markup, basic navigation, and support for essential features that work for everyone.

* **Layered Enhancements:** Add layers of enhancements on top of the core functionality. These can include additional styling, interactivity, animations, advanced features, or performance optimizations.

* **Device/Context Independence:** Ensure the system works well on a variety of devices, including older browsers, smaller screens, or limited bandwidth connections. Take into account different user contexts, such as varying input methods (mouse, touch, keyboard), screen sizes, or accessibility needs.

* **Flexibility:** By building a UI in a progressively enhanced manner, it becomes more flexible and adaptable to future changes in technology. New features or enhancements can be easily added on top of the existing foundation without compromising the core functionality.

* **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility by ensuring that users with disabilities can access and interact with the UI. Enable implementation of accessible design practices, such as via ARIA attributes, and provide a more inclusive user experience.
