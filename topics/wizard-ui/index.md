# Wizard UI

A wizard user interface is a step-by-step interactive process that guides users through a series of tasks or decisions. It simplifies complex processes and makes them more manageable for users. Wizards are commonly used in a variety of applications and scenarios, such as user registrations, onboarding processes, form submissions, configuration setups, and complex task workflows.

**Key aspects:**

* **Task Chunking:** Break down complex tasks or processes into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps users focus, reducing cognitive load.

* **Step-by-Step Progression:** Provide a sequence of screens or pages, with each step representing a specific task or decision point. Guide users through the process by moving forward.

* **Clear Instructions and Guidance:** Provide clear instructions and guidance to users at each step. This helps users understand what they need to do and what information they are required to provide.

* **Validation:** Provide real-time feedback to users as they complete each step. This can include validation of user inputs, error messages, or confirmation of successful completion of a step.

* **Flow:** Provide a flow and structure that users follow to progress through the process. Users typically have the ability to navigate back and forth between steps to review or modify their inputs.

* **Progress Indicators:** Use visual design elements as progress indicators, such as progress bars or step counters, to show users how far they have progressed and how many steps are remaining.

* **Flexibility:** Potentially enable users to skip steps that are not relevant to them or provide options for customizing the experience based on user preferences or requirements.
