# Wizard UI

A wizard user interface is a step-by-step interactive process that guides users through a series of tasks or decisions. It is designed to simplify complex processes and make them more manageable for users by breaking them down into smaller, sequential steps. Wizards are commonly used in a variety of applications and scenarios, such as user registrations, onboarding processes, form submissions, configuration setups, and complex task workflows.

**Key aspects**:

Task Chunking: Break down complex tasks or processes into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps users focus on one step at a time, reducing cognitive load and making the overall process easier.

Step-by-Step Progression: Provide a sequence of screens or pages, with each step representing a specific task or decision point. Users are guided through the process by moving forward from one step to the next.

Clear Instructions and Guidance: Provide clear instructions and guidance to users at each step. This helps users understand what they need to do and what information they are required to provide.

Validation: Provide real-time feedback to users as they complete each step. This can include validation of user inputs, error messages, or confirmation of successful completion of a step.

Flow: Provide a flow and structure that users follow to progress through the process. Users typically have the ability to navigate back and forth between steps to review or modify their inputs.

Progress Indicators: Use visual design elements as progress indicators, such as progress bars or step counters, to show users how far they have progressed and how many steps are remaining.

Flexibility: Potentially enable users to skip steps that are not relevant to them or provide options for customizing the experience based on user preferences or requirements.
