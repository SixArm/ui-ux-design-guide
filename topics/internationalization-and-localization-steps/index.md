# Internationalization and localization: steps

**Internationalization typical steps:**

1. **Plan and Analyze:** Define the scope of the internationalization effort, identify the target markets, and analyze the cultural and linguistic requirements of those markets. Assess the existing software or product design for potential internationalization issues.

2. **Design and Develop:** Create the product or software using best practices for internationalization. Ensuring that the product can handle various character sets, date and time formats, and other regional differences.

**Localization typical steps:**

1. **Translate**: Translate all text, audio, and video content must be translated into the language of the target market.

2. **Adapt**: Adapt the content to the culture of the target market. This includes adapting images, symbols, colors, and other visual elements to be more appropriate for the target market.

3. **Format**: Adjust text to accommodate different character sets or writing systems. Dates, times, and other information may also need to be presented in a different format.

**Shared steps:**

1. **Test:** Verify the software's internationalization and localization, in each target market.

2. **Maintain:** Offer maintenance and support, to ensure that the product continues to meet the needs of each target market.
