# Timing diagram

A timing diagram is a graphical representation of the timing and duration of signals or events in a digital system or electronic circuit. It is commonly used in electronics, digital communication systems, and software engineering to visualize the temporal behavior of a system.

Timing diagrams consist of horizontal and vertical axes, where the horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents signal values. The diagram is divided into several rows or lanes, with each lane representing a different signal or event.

The signal values can be represented in several ways, including voltage levels, logic states, or data values. In digital systems, signal values are usually represented as high or low logic states, where a high state represents a logical 1, and a low state represents a logical 0.

Timing diagrams can be used to visualize a variety of signals and events, including clock signals, data signals, control signals, and system responses. They can also be used to analyze the timing and performance of a system, including clock speeds, signal propagation delays, and system latencies.

Timing diagrams can be created using various software tools, including simulation software and specialized drawing programs. They can also be created manually using graph paper or other drawing tools.
