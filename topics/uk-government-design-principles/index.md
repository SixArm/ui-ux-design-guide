# UK Government Design Principles

**Start with user needs.** Do research, analyse data, talk to users. Don’t make assumptions. Have empathy for users. Remember that what they ask for isn’t always what they need.

**Do less.** If something works, make it reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time. Provide resources (like APIs) that others can use, and link to the work of others.

**Design with data.** Let data drive decision-making, not hunches or guesswork. Prototype and test with users, then iterate. Analytics should be built-in, always on, and easy to read.

**Do the hard work to make it simple.** Making something simple to use is hard - especially when the underlying systems are complex. Don’t take “It’s always been that way” for an answer.

**Iterate.** The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release minimum viable products early, test them with actual users, and make refinements based on feedback.

**This is for everyone.** Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it.

**Understand context.** We’re not designing for a screen, we’re designing for people. We need to think hard about the context in which they’re using our services. Where are they? How experienced are they?

**Build services, not websites.** A service is something that helps people to do something. Uncover user needs, and build the service that meets those needs. The digital world has to connect to the real world.

**Be consistent, not uniform.** Use the same language and the same design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar. When this isn’t possible, make sure your approach is consistent.

**Make things open.** Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes the better things get.
