# Reactive UI

Reactive UI, also known as Reactive User Interface, is an approach to user interface design and development that focuses on building responsive and interactive user interfaces. It involves designing UI components that react to changes in data or user input, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience. Reactive UI is often associated with reactive programming frameworks such as React and Angular.

Key conceptsâ€¦

Data Binding: Reactive UI frameworks provide mechanisms for establishing data bindings between the UI components and the underlying data model. This allows the UI to automatically update.

Declarative UI: Describe how the UI should look and behave based on the current state of the data, instead of imperatively manipulating the UI.

Component-Based Architecture: UI elements are reusable components that encapsulate their own state and behavior. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

Reactive Programming: Focus on managing asynchronous data streams and propagating changes through a stream of events, including complex event-driven behavior and asynchronous tasks.

Event-Driven Interactions: Handle user interactions and events in a reactive and composable way, such as by defining event handlers that react to user input or other events.

State Management: Reactive UI frameworks typically provide mechanisms for managing application state in a reactive manner, making it easier to synchronize the UI with the data model.
