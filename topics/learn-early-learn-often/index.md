# Learn early, learn often

"Learn early, learn often" is a quotation by Drew Houston, co-founder of Dropbox . The phrase is popular in the startup community because it emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and experimentation. It suggests that it is better to start learning and experimenting early on in the development of a product or service, rather than waiting until later when it may be more difficult and expensive to make changes.

The concept behind "Learn early, learn often" is closely tied to the lean startup methodology, which emphasizes rapid experimentation and iteration to quickly validate or invalidate assumptions about a product or service. By learning early and often, startups can quickly identify and correct errors in their assumptions, refine their products or services, and make data-driven decisions.

The "learn" part of the phrase refers to the importance of acquiring knowledge and insights through experimentation, feedback, and data analysis. This learning can come from a variety of sources, such as user feedback, market research, customer behavior analysis, and product usage metrics.

The "early" part of the phrase refers to the importance of starting the learning process as soon as possible, even before a product or service is fully developed or launched.

The "often" part of the phrase emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and iteration throughout the product development process. This means that startups should be constantly testing and experimenting with new ideas, features, and improvements, and using data to inform their decisions.

The quotation effectively encourages startups to adopt a culture of continuous learning and experimentation, and to be agile and responsive to feedback and data. By doing so, they can increase their chances of success, avoid costly mistakes, and ultimately create products or services that better meet the needs and desires of their customers.
