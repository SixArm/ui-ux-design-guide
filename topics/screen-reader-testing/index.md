# Screen reader testing

Screen reader testing is the process of evaluating the accessibility and usability of a digital interface for individuals who rely on screen readers to access content. It involves assessing how well a website, application, or other digital product can be perceived, navigated, and interacted with using a screen reader.

Key aspectsâ€¦

* Screen Reader Selection: There are several screen readers available, such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. Choose the screen reader(s) that align with your target audience and platform requirements.

* Interaction: Use the screen reader to navigate through the system. Ensure that all elements, such as headings, links, buttons, form controls, input prompts, error messages, and landmarks, are properly recognized and announced. Verify that users can interact with the interface using keyboard commands or voice commands, and that interactive elements respond as expected.

* Alternative Content: Assess the accessibility of multimedia content, such as videos, audio players, and interactive components. Check if the screen reader provides information about the presence of multimedia, offers controls for playback, and conveys relevant details or alternatives.

* Usability: Evaluate the overall usability and user experience for screen reader users. Note of any usability issues, navigation challenges, or difficulties. Plan to make necessary improvements.

* Assistive Technology Compatibility: In addition to screen readers, consider testing compatibility with other assistive technologies that users may rely on, such as screen magnifiers, speech recognition software, or alternative input devices.
