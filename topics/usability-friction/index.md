# Usability friction

Usability friction refers to the resistance or obstacles that users may encounter when interacting with a product. It encompasses any elements that make the user experience less smooth or efficient. Reducing friction is a key goal in product design because it can lead to improved user satisfaction, increased engagement, and better overall product performance.

**Common friction areas:**

* **UI:** Complicated or cluttered user interfaces.

* **Slowness:** Slow loading times for websites, or slow running times for applications.

* **Onboarding:** Lengthy or complex sign-up processes or setup steps.

* **Navigation:** Unclear navigation or confusing menu structures.

* **Data Entry:** Long or complex forms can be tiresome for users.

* **Errors:** Inadequate error messages or lack of feedback can lead to user confusion.

* **Payments:** Purchasing processes with too many steps or security complexity.

* **Inaccessibility:** Inaccessible design for people with disabilities.

* **Mobile:** Inconsistent or poorly responsive design on mobile devices.

* **Waste:** Unnecessary steps or actions required to complete a task.

* **Overload:** Too much information or too many choices.
