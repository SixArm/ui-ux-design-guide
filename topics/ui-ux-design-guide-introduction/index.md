# What is this book?

UI/UX Design Guide is a glossary guide ebook that describes one topic per page. The guide is intended for quick easy learning about concepts, tactics, and ideas.

### Why these topics?

All the topics here are chosen because they have come up in real-world UI/UX work, with real-world stakeholders who want to learn about the topic.

If you have suggestions for more topics, then please let me know.

Some of the topics are related, so they are grouped into sections. For example, see the topic about task analysis: in the table of contents, it's listed as the first topic in a section that contains various kinds of task analysis techniques. The section grouping is intended to help readers get up to speed faster. If you have suggestions for new groups, or topics that should be in existing groups, then please let me know.

### What is the topic order?

You can read any topic page, in any order, at any time. Each topic page is intended be clear on its own, without needing cross-references or links.


## Who is this for?

People should read this guide if they want to learn quickly about user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) development, and how these concepts are practiced in companies today.

### For practitioners

For UI/UX practitioners, this guide is intending to summarize and distill many of your daily concepts and terminology. For you, the value of the guide is in being able to quickly and easily teach stakeholders about general UI/UX topics. For example, if you want to use a particular technique such as user-centered design or task analysis with your stakeholders, then you can quickly and easily direct the stakeholders to this guide and its relevant topic pages, as one aspect of your communications. You can freely excerpt, remix, and share these pages with your coworkers.

### For stakeholders

When you know the right terminology, then you're better-able to share information, collaborate, and create the working relationships that you value.

### For students

If students are able to learn what's in this book, they will have a big advantage when they go for job interviews for roles that involve UI/UX.


## Why am I creating this?

I am creating this ebook because of years of experience in UI/UX work, with a wide range of clients, from small startups to enormous enterprises.


### For team collaboration

When I work with companies and teams, then I'm able to use glossaries like this one to help create shared context and clearer communication. This can accelerate working together, and can help teams forge better UI/UX, in my direct experience.

For example, one of my enterprise clients describes this kind of shared context and clear communication in a positive sense as "singing from the same songbook". When a team understands UI/UX terminology, and has a quick easy glossary for definitions and explanations, then it's akin to teammates with the same songbook.


### For cross-cultural communication

What I discovered is that these kinds of glossaries can be especially helpful for teams with members coming from various cultures, such as from different countries, or different industries, or different ways of working. The topic pages help provide a baseline for better collaboration.
