# Use cases and user stories

Use cases and user stories are two techniques used in software development to capture requirements from the user's perspective, but they have some key differences.

A use case is a technique used to capture the interactions between a system and its users or other systems. It is a detailed description of how a user or system interacts with a system to accomplish a specific goal. Use cases are typically represented as diagrams or flowcharts that show the different steps in the interaction and the possible outcomes.

A user story, on the other hand, is a short, simple statement that describes a user's need or requirement for a product or system. It is often written in a specific format: "As a [type of user], I want [some feature or capability], so that [some benefit or outcome]." User stories are typically used in Agile software development to help prioritize work and ensure that the development team is building features that meet the user's needs.

One key difference between use cases and user stories is their level of detail. Use cases are typically more detailed and comprehensive than user stories, as they describe the specific interactions between the user and the system in greater detail. User stories, on the other hand, are typically shorter and more focused on the user's needs and desired outcomes.

Another difference is the way they are used in the development process. Use cases are often used in more traditional, Waterfall-style development processes, where requirements are captured up front and the development team follows a structured plan. User stories, on the other hand, are more commonly used in Agile development processes, where requirements are captured in an iterative and incremental manner and the development team adapts to changing needs and priorities.
