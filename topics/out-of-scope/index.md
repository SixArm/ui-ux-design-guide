# Out of scope

"Out of scope" is a phrase commonly used in project management, business analysis, and other fields to indicate that a particular task or activity is not within the bounds of the current project or assignment.

When someone says that a task or activity is "out of scope," they are essentially saying that it is not something that they are currently responsible for, or that it is not something that they can work on within the context of their current project or assignment.

For example, suppose a software development team is working on a project to create a new e-commerce platform for a client. If the client were to request additional features that were not part of the original scope of the project, the project manager might respond by saying that the new features are "out of scope." This means that the team will not be able to work on the new features as part of the current project, and that the client will need to initiate a new project or change request to address them.

In other contexts, the phrase "out of scope" can also be used to indicate that a particular problem or issue is not relevant to a particular discussion or debate. For example, if two people are having a conversation about the best way to market a new product, and one person starts talking about the technical details of how the product was designed, the other person might say that the technical details are "out of scope" for the current discussion. This would indicate that they believe the technical details are not relevant to the discussion about marketing the product.
