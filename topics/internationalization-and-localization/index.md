# Internationalization and localization

Internationalization and localization are steps in the process of creating software or a website that can be used by people in different regions of the world, from different cultures, and speaking different langauges.

Internationalization (often abbreviated as i18n) is the process of designing software or a website so that it can be easily localized for different languages, cultures, and regions.

* This process involves making sure that all user interface text is separate from the code, that dates, times, and other regional settings are properly handled, and that the software is designed to work with a wide range of character sets and other language-specific features.

* The goal of internationalization is to make it easy to create localized versions of the software in the future, without having to make significant changes to the underlying code.

Localization (often abbreviated as l10n) is the process of translating software or a website into different languages and adapting it for use in different regions.

* This process involves translating all user interface text, adapting the software to work with local date and time formats, currencies, and other region-specific settings, and making any other necessary changes to make the software more appropriate for use in that region.

* The goal of localization is to create a version of the software that is easy and natural for users in that region to use, even if they do not speak the same language as the original developers.

In short, internationalization is the process of making software ready for localization, while localization is the process of adapting software to work well in a particular region.
