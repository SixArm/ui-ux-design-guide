# Cause-and-effect diagram

A cause-and-effect diagram, also known as an Ishikawa diagram or fishbone diagram, is a visual tool used to analyze and solve problems. The diagram is shaped like a fishbone, with the problem statement or effect placed at the head of the fish, and the potential causes branching out along the spine. They were developed by quality control expert Kaoru Ishikawa, and are often used in manufacturing, engineering, and quality management.

A cause-and-effect diagram is a structured tool that helps identify possible causes of a particular problem or event. It is based on the idea that there are multiple factors that contribute to a problem, and that by identifying and addressing these factors, the problem can be solved.

There are six main categories of causes known as "6 Ms":

* **Manpower** (people)

* **Methods** (processes)

* **Machines** (equipment)

* **Materials** (inputs)

* **Measurements** (data)

* **Mother nature** (environmental conditions)

The diagramming process involves brainstorming the possible causes of the problem and organizing them into these categories. This is typically done in a group setting, with a team of people who have knowledge and experience related to the problem. Once the possible causes are identified, they are analyzed and prioritized, and potential solutions can be developed and implemented.

Cause-and-effect diagrams are useful for identifying root causes of a problem. They are also helpful in promoting collaboration, as they allow different perspectives and areas of expertise to be brought together in a structured way.
