# Modeling diagrams

Modeling diagrams are graphical representations that help visualize software systems or processes. They provide a visual representation of the system's architecture, structure, and behavior, which can be used to communicate the system's design to stakeholders.

Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides many common diagramsâ€¦

Use Case Diagram: A use case diagram shows the interactions between actors and the system in different scenarios. It is used to define and clarify the requirements of the system and to identify the actors that interact with the system.

Class Diagram: A class diagram represents the static structure of the system by showing the classes, attributes, and methods that make up the system. It helps to visualize the relationships between different classes in the system.

Sequence Diagram: A sequence diagram shows how objects interact with each other over time. It helps to visualize the flow of information and control between different objects in the system.

Activity Diagram: An activity diagram shows the flow of activities or actions within a system. It is used to model the workflow or business process of the system.

State Diagram: A state diagram shows the states and transitions that an object goes through in response to events. It helps to model the behavior of the system by showing how the system responds to external stimuli.

Component Diagram: A component diagram shows the organization and dependencies between software components in a system. It is used to visualize the high-level architecture of the system.

Deployment Diagram: A deployment diagram shows how the software components are deployed on hardware nodes. It helps to visualize the physical architecture of the system.
