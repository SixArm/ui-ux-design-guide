# Modeling diagrams

Modeling diagrams are graphical representations that help visualize software systems or processes. They provide a visual representation of the system's architecture, structure, and behavior, which can be used to communicate the system's design to stakeholders.

**Common diagrams:**

* **Use Case Diagram:** Show interactions between actors and the system in different scenarios. Define and clarify the requirements of the system and to identify the actors that interact with the system.

* **Class Diagram:** Represents the static structure of the system by showing the classes, attributes, and methods that make up the system. Visualize the relationships among classes.

* **Sequence Diagram:** Shows how objects interact with each other over time. Visualize the flow of information and control between different objects in the system.

* **Activity Diagram:** Shows the flow of activities or actions within a system. Model the workflow or business process of the system.

* **State Diagram:** Show states and transitions that an object goes through in response to events. Model the behavior of the system by showing how the system responds to external stimuli.

* **Component Diagram:** Show the organization and dependencies between software components in a system. Visualize the high-level architecture of the system.

* **Deployment Diagram:** Show how the software components are deployed on hardware nodes. Visualize the physical architecture of the system.
