# Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) is a method used to break down complex tasks into a hierarchical structure of subtasks, actions, and operations. It provides a systematic way of representing the relationships between different levels of tasks, allowing for a detailed understanding of the task's structure, goals, and dependencies. HTA can help with process evaluations, schedule planning, risk identification, training needs, and workflow optimizations.

**General process::**

* **Task Identification:** Select a specific task to analyze. Clearly define the boundaries of the task and identify its overall goal or objective.

* **Decomposition:** Break down the task into subtasks. Start with the highest level or top-level task and decompose it into more specific subtasks, actions, and operations. Each item is a meaningful unit of work.

* **Task Relationships:** Identify dependencies and relationships among tasks and subtasks. Determine any conditional relationships, schedule ordering, or constraints between them.

* **Documentation:** Document the HTA using visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, or outlines. The hierarchy should clearly represent the relationships between tasks and the flow of work.

* **Evaluation:** Review the HTA and seek feedback from subject matter experts or individuals who perform the task. Identify any missing or redundant steps, clarify ambiguities, and revise the analysis as needed.
