# Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern widely used in designing and developing applications. It separates an application's data (Model), user interface (View), and the logic that connects the two (Controller) into distinct components. Key benefits of using the MVC pattern include modular design, separation of concerns, code reusability, simultaneous development, and better testability.

The MVC patternâ€¦

Model: The Model component represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data structure, storage, and operations related to the application's data. The Model is responsible for managing data access, manipulation, and validation. It operates independently of the user interface and notifies the View and Controller of any changes in the data.

View: The View component is responsible for the presentation layer of the application. It represents the user interface and is responsible for displaying the data to the user. Views are typically designed to be visually appealing and provide an intuitive user experience. In the MVC pattern, the View is passive and does not contain any application logic. It receives data from the Model and presents it to the user.

Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It handles user input, manipulates the data in the Model, and updates the View accordingly. The Controller receives input from the user via the View, processes it, and updates the Model. It also listens to changes in the Model and updates the View to reflect those changes. The Controller is responsible for maintaining the flow of data and interactions between the Model and View.
