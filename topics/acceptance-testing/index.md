# Acceptance testing

Acceptance testing is a type of software testing that evaluates whether a software application meets the requirements and specifications of the client or user. This type of testing is conducted to ensure that the software application is ready for deployment and use by end-users.

The goal of acceptance testing is to verify that the software meets the client's requirements and performs as expected. The testing process is typically conducted by end-users, business analysts, or quality assurance professionals, who evaluate the application's functionality, usability, and performance.

There are two main types of acceptance testing:

* Functional acceptance testing evaluates the software's functionality, including its features, behavior, and compliance with the client's requirements.

* Non-functional acceptance testing assesses the application's performance, scalability, security, and other non-functional aspects.

The acceptance testing process generally involves creating test cases, scenarios, and scripts that replicate real-world scenarios and user interactions. Testers may also use automated testing tools to streamline the testing process and ensure that the software is tested thoroughly.

The acceptance testing process usually occurs after the completion of integration testing and system testing. Successful completion of acceptance testing is a critical milestone for software development, indicating that the software is ready for release to end-users.
