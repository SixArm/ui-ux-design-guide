# Keyboard shortcut (a.k.a. hotkey)

A keyboard shortcut, also known as a hotkey or key combination, is a combination of one or more keys on a computer keyboard that triggers a specific action or command in a software application or operating system. Keyboard shortcuts are designed to provide a quick and efficient way for users to perform common tasks. Examples include Ctrl+C (copy), Ctrl+V (paste), and Alt+Tab (switch between open applications).

**Key aspects**:

Accelerate Workflow: Keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up workflows by eliminating the need to navigate through menus or use the mouse for every action.

Increased Productivity: By reducing the reliance on mouse movements and clicks, keyboard shortcuts allow you to perform tasks more efficiently.

Accessibility: Keyboard shortcuts offer an alternative method of interaction for individuals with mobility impairments or those who prefer keyboard-based navigation.

Consistency and Standardization: Many software applications and operating systems follow a set of standardized keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl+Z for undo. This consistency enhances user familiarity and ease of use.

Customization: Some systems provide options for the user to customize or create their own keyboard shortcuts, to align with their preferences or for specific actions that are not available by default.

Learning Curve: Keyboard shortcuts can have a learning curve, especially when starting with a new software application or operating system. However, investing time in learning commonly used shortcuts can improve efficiency and productivity in the long run.
