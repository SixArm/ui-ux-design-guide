# Keyboard shortcut (a.k.a. hotkey)

A keyboard shortcut, also known as a hotkey or key combination, is a combination of one or more keys on a computer keyboard that triggers a specific action or command in a software application or operating system. Keyboard shortcuts are designed to provide a quick and efficient way for users to perform common tasks without relying solely on mouse clicks or navigating through menus.

Here are a few key points about keyboard shortcuts:

* Accelerate Workflow: Keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up your workflow by eliminating the need to navigate through menus or use the mouse for every action. With a simple key press or combination, you can perform tasks much faster than using traditional mouse-based interactions.

* Increased Productivity: By reducing the reliance on mouse movements and clicks, keyboard shortcuts allow you to perform tasks more efficiently. This can help increase productivity, especially for repetitive actions or tasks that require frequent interaction with the software.

* Accessibility: Keyboard shortcuts offer an alternative method of interaction for individuals with mobility impairments or those who prefer keyboard-based navigation. They provide an accessible way to access various functions and commands without relying solely on mouse-based controls.

* Consistency and Standardization: Many software applications and operating systems follow a set of standardized keyboard shortcuts. For example, Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste are widely used across different applications. This consistency allows users to transfer their knowledge of shortcuts from one application to another, enhancing familiarity and ease of use.

* Customization: In some applications or operating systems, you may have the option to customize or create your own keyboard shortcuts. This allows you to personalize the shortcuts to align with your preferences or to create shortcuts for specific actions that are not available by default.

* Learning Curve: Keyboard shortcuts can have a learning curve, especially when starting with a new software application or operating system. However, investing time in learning commonly used shortcuts can greatly improve your efficiency and productivity in the long run.

Examples of commonly used keyboard shortcuts include Ctrl+C (copy), Ctrl+V (paste), Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+S (save), Ctrl+P (print), and Alt+Tab (switch between open applications). The specific shortcuts may vary depending on the software application or operating system you are using.

By incorporating keyboard shortcuts into your workflow, you can streamline your tasks, increase productivity, and navigate through software applications more efficiently. Learning and utilizing commonly used shortcuts can significantly enhance your overall computer experience.
